# Segmentation-of-Lungs

From the Finding and Identifying the Lungs in CT Data, I used the 2D CT scans to build a segmentation classifier with approximately 97.7% accuracy to identify the lungs in the CT scan. I used the FastAI Visison library to achieve this.

I modified the existing segmentation class and used a UNet Learner with a ResNet50 architecture to create the desired binary segmentation classifier.
